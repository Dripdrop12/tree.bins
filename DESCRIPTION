Description: The package takes in a data set of categorical variables and a response variable. 
    It creates a decision tree by using one of the categorical variables and the response variable. 
    The decision tree is created from the rpart function from the rpart library. The rules from the leaves of
    the decision tree are extracted, and used to recategorize the used variable (predictor). This
    step is performed for each of the categorical variables that is fed into the data component of
    the function. Only variables containing more than 2 factors will be considered in the function. 
    The final output generates a data set containing the recategorized variables.
