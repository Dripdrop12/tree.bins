## Overview
-----------

The package takes in a data set of categorical variables and a response variable. 
It creates a decision tree by using one of the categorical variables (class factor) and the selected response variable. 
The decision tree is created from the rpart function from the rpart library. The rules from the leaves of
the decision tree are extracted, and used to recategorize the appropriate categorical variable (predictor). This
step is performed for each of the categorical variables that is fed into the data component of
the function. Only variables containing more than 2 factor levels will be considered in the function. 
The final output generates a data set containing the recategorized variables or a list containing a mapping table
for each of the candidate variables. 

## Installation
---------------

You can install tree.bins from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pikos90/tree.bins")
```

## Usage

Uses tree.bins() to recategorize your data

```{r example}
## basic example code
sample.df <- AmesImpFctrs[, c("Neighborhood","MS.Zoning", "SalePrice" )]
recategorized.df <- tree.bins(data = sample.df, y = SalePrice)
head(recategorized.df)
```

Uses tree.bins() to create a list of mapping tables and uses that list to recategorize your a different data set with bin.oth()

```{r example}
## basic example code
sample.df <- AmesImpFctrs[, c("Neighborhood","MS.Zoning", "SalePrice" )]
recategorized.list <- tree.bins(data = sample.df, y = SalePrice, return = "lkup.list")

other.sample.df <- AmesImpFctrs[, c("Neighborhood","MS.Zoning", "Sale.Condition", "SalePrice" )]
other.df <- bin.oth(list = recategorized.list, data = other.sample.df)
head(other.df)
```
